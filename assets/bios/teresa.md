Dr. Palomero is a Professor of Pathology and Cell Biology at the Institute for Cancer Genetics
at Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC). Over the last years she has leveraged
the power of next generation sequencing approaches to identify novel oncogenes and tumor suppressors
in T-ALL ([Van Vlierberghe et al. 2010](https://doi.org/10.1038/ng.542))
and peripheral T-cell lymphomas ([da Silva Almeida et al. 2015](https://doi.org/10.1038/ng.3442))
and drivers of resistance to chemotherapy in relapsed leukemias ([Oshima et al. 2016](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1608420113)).

Her current research focuses on the elucidation of the oncogenic mechanisms driven by these
genetic alterations, the development of genetically manipulated mouse models of T-cell lymphoma
and the therapeutic targeting of key oncogenic pathways responsible for T-cell transformation.
