Dr. Palomero is a Professor of Pathology and Cell Biology at the Institute for
Cancer Genetics at Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC). Over the
last years she has leveraged the power of next generation sequencing approaches
to identify novel oncogenes and tumor suppressors in T-ALL (van Vlierberghe and
Palomero et al, 2009) and peripheral T-cell lymphomas (Palomero et al., Nat
Genet 2014; da Silva Almeida et al., Nat Genet, 2015) and drivers of resistance
to chemotherapy in relapsed leukemias (Tzoneva et al., Nat Med 2013; Oshima et
al., PNAS 2016). Her current research focuses on the elucidation of the
oncogenic mechanisms driven by these genetic alterations, the development of
genetically manipulated mouse models of T-cell lymphoma and the therapeutic
targeting of key oncogenic pathways responsible for T-cell transformation.
